=head1 DESCRIPTION

SWISH::HiLiter is a simple interface to Search::Tools. It is designed
to work specifically with the SWISH::API module for searching Swish-e 
indexes and displaying snippets of highlighted text from 
the stored Swish-e properties.

SWISH::HiLiter is B<NOT> a drop-in replacement for the highlighting modules that
come with the Swish-e distribution. Instead, it is intended to be used when programming
with SWISH::API.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

=over

=item

Search::Tools 0.25 or later.

If you intend to use full-page highlighting, also get the HTML::Parser and its
required modules.

=item

Perl 5.8.3 or later.

=item

SWISH::API 0.04 or later.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Create a SWISH::HiLiter object. The new() method takes either a single parameter (a
SWISH::API object), or a hash of parameter key/values. Available parameters include:

=over

=item swish

A SWISH::API object. Version 0.03 or newer. [ Required ]

=item colors

A reference to an array of HTML color names.

=item query

The query string you want highlighted.

=item occur

How many query matches to display when running snip(). See also Search::Tools::Snipper.

=item max_chars

Number of words around match to return in snip(). See also Search::Tools::Snipper.

=item noshow

Bashful setting. If snip() fails to match any of your query (as can happen if the match
is beyond the range of SwishDescription as set in your index), don't show anything. The
default is to show the first I<max_chars> of the text. See also snip=>'dumb'.

=item snip

See Search::Tools::Snipper for a description of the different snipping
algorithms.

=item escape

Your text is assumed not to contain HTML markup and so it is HTML-escaped by default.
If you have included markup in your text and want it left as-is, set 'escape' to 0. Highlighting
should still work, but snip() might break.

=back

=head2 light( I<text> )

Returns highlighted I<text>. See new() for ways to control context, length, etc.

=head2 stem( I<word> )

Return the stemmed version of a word. Only works if your first index in SWISH::API
object used Fuzzy Mode.

This method is just a wrapper around SWISH::API::Fuzzify.

The stem() method is called internally by the Search::Tools::QueryParser.

B<NOTE:> stem() requires SWISH::API version 0.04 or newer. If you have an older
SWISH::API, first consider upgrading (0.03 is very old), and second, set C<no_stemmer>
in new() to turn off stemming.

=head2 set_query( I<query> )

Set the query in the highlighting object. Called automatically by new() if
'query' is present in the new() call.

You should only call set_query() if you are trying to re-use a SWISH::HiLiter
object, as when under a persistent environment like mod_perl or in a loop.

Like query(), return the internal Search::Tools::Query object representing I<query>.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

If your text contains HTML markup and escape = 0, snip() may fail to return
valid HTML. I don't consider this a bug, but listing here in case it happens to you.

Stemming and regular expression building considers only the first index's header values
from your SWISH::API object. If those header values differ (for example, WordCharacters
is defined differently), be aware that only the first index from SWISH::API::IndexNames is used.

B<REMINDER:> Use HTML::HiLiter to highlight full HTML pages;
use SWISH::HiLiter to highlight plain text and smaller HTML chunks.
